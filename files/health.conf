indicator:sum_top3_cpu_percs__max_last_3m:description = This indicator tracks the sum of IOWait percentage for the three most bottle-necked CPUs on the machine running the Splunk Enterprise instance, over the last 3 minute window. By default, this indicator will turn Yellow if the sum exceeds 7% and Red if it exceeds 15% during this window.
